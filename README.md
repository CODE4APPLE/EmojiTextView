# EmojiTextView
Text view with easy emoji input inspired by iOS 10's Messages.app.



## Future Improvements:

- [ ] Should the emoji replacement be enabled only when the emoji keyboard is selected? It probably requires use of the private API as `UITextInputMode` doesn't help here.
- [ ] If there's more than one emoji match for a given word there should be ability to choose which one we want to use.
- [ ] **(EASY)** There should be an option to switch back from an emoji to the full word. Hint: add an attribute with the original word to the part of the string replaced by an emoji.
