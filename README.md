# EmojiTextView

Tap to swap out words with emojis. Works with any `UITextView`. Heavily inspired by Messages.app on iOS 10.

## Usage

Add a property of `EmojiController` type to a class that holds your `UITextView` instance, e.g. a view controller:

```swift
var emojiController: EmojiController?
```

Then, initialize `EmojiController` by passing it your text view (e.g. in `viewDidLoad()`):

```swift
emojiController = EmojiController(textView: textView)
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

## Customization

`EmojiController` provides three points of customization through properties:

- `mapping` â€“ contains a mapping from words to an array of emojis
- `textHighlightingFactory` â€“ creates a new instance of an object conforming to `TextHighlighting` protocol; each instance of that object is responsible for highlighting a single word
- `defaultAttributes` - attributes (as in `NSAttributedString`) of a text that's not replaceable with emoji

## Installation

EmojiTextView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod "EmojiTextView", "0.0.1"
```

Then you can import it with:

```swift
import EmojiTextView
```

## Requirements

iOS 9 and above.

## Future Improvements

- Should the emoji replacement be enabled only when the emoji keyboard is selected? It probably requires the use of the private API as `UITextInputMode` doesn't help here.
- If there's more than one emoji match for a given word there should be an ability to choose which one we want to use.
- **(EASY)** There should be an option to switch back from an emoji to the full word. Hint: add an attribute with the original word to the part of the string replaced by an emoji.
